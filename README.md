Example Code
Here’s a brief look at how the plugin checks for plugin and theme updates:
```
function check_for_updates() {
    $plugins = get_plugin_updates();
    $themes = wp_get_themes();

    if (!empty($plugins)) {
        foreach ($plugins as $plugin) {
            echo '<p>' . $plugin->Name . ' needs an update.</p>';
        }
    }

    if (!empty($themes)) {
        foreach ($themes as $theme) {
            echo '<p>' . $theme->Name . ' needs an update.</p>';
        }
    }
}
```
